Please take the time to read the information below so you know what to expect on the day - don't miss the bit about the after party (it's near the bottom).

## Hotels

There are plenty of hotels and B&Bs to stay in Brighton, some
recommended ones include [The Granville Hotel](http://www.granvillehotel.co.uk/ ""), [MyHotel](http://www.myhotels.com/my-hotel-brighton/index.html?gclid=CPmL7vey6MECFcrKtAodAXAApw "") and [Jurys Inn](http://www.jurysinns.com/hotels/brighton/ ""). A good site to check availability
is [hotels.com](http://www.hotels.com/ "")

## Getting here

Brighton is well served with public transport and parking is expensive, so getting a train or bus can be preferable to driving.
