Founder UX Brighton

curator of ux brighton 2014 - **our 5th conference!**

**@uxbri**

@yandle

pictures - we’d love to see loads of pictures - snap away

theres 1 talk later on where pictures arent allowed but I’ll remind you at the time

**why philosophy?**

Learning about philosophy improves many aspects of your work as a designer

- the design ideas themselves - metaphors and assumptions in the ideas
- disecting those in teams
- and testing them with users

thinking about things makes us better at making things

# Marianne Talbot

One of the things that got me into philosophy was listening to philosophy podcasts

Possibly the 1st for me was Marianne Talbot’s excellent "Romp through the History of Philosophy" way back in 2008.

--roughly 1,000,000 downloads

--went on to monopolise the entire iTunesU top 10

--As philosophy forms an important foundation for design, Marianne’s talk, I think, will form a foundation for today.

So *I’m very excited to welcome* **Marianne Talbot**

## Sjors
------------------------------------------------------

In chatting with our speakers and doing my own research for this years event,

I kept coming across an old term that I’d never heard of but which seemed to be very useful for designers, especially in the kind of situations which Andy was describing.

Hands up who’s familiar with the term hermenutics?

Right?!

So when Sjors informed me, a few days ago, that he was goign to change his talk to focus on Hermenutics, I was a very happy man!

Please *give him a warm welcome*; **Sjors Timmer**

## Anna Cox

--speakers touched on the need to balance sceince. With these last 2 talks, we’ll try and expand on this matter.

I’m a scientist at heart so I often find myself trying to explain to others what good science is.

So I’ve asked Anna Cox along to show me how it’s done.

Anna is Deputy Director of the UCL Interaction Centre and a Reader in HCI

*Please give her a warm round of applause,* **Anna Cox**

## Andy Clarke

I’m an artist at heart so…

When I heard our next speaker discuss the creative genius of 60s ad agencies, and fight the corner for what we might call a less scientific approach to design. I thought he would be the perfect person to round off the day.

*Please welcome, one of web design’s most well respected designers,* **Andy Clarke**

# Unsorted

scheduled breaks seats not the best

**thinking about things makes us better at making things**

**Before or after breaks mention the after party/food**

I’m freelance, how many others are?
- agency?
- in house?
- of those startups?
- student?



# Meta

eye contact with individuals!

Be nicer to speakers after their talks say more about how great they are
