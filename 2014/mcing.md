1 caveat - Martin

"Why philosophy?" pointless by definition – you’re here!

# Marianne Talbot
Marianne is Director Of Studies in Philosophy at the University of Oxford’s Department for Continuing Education.

In 2008, I, along with roughly 1 million others started listening to Marianne’s Philosophy podcast. A podcast which has held every position in the iTunes U top 10 CONCURRENTLY.

As philosophy forms an important foundation for design, Marianne’s talk, I think, will form a foundation for today.

So please *welcome to the stage* **Marianne Talbot**

*Design thinker*

# Meta

repeat the main point over and over to make sure people get it – **thinking about things makes us better at making things**

When introducing speakers say their name loudly as a prompt to applaud

# Unsorted
We’ve tried arranged the schedule so that breaks are a bit more spaced out, we know these seats aren’t the most comfortable in the world
going to uxcamp?
Who’s a student? Where?
How many of you are from startups?

Slides and later on video from the event will be available on the conference page.


One of the definitions of philosophy is THE LOVE OF THINKING so you are all the best people in UX because you THINK about what you’re doing!

**Before or after breaks mention the after party/food**

Get people to introduce themselves to their neighbour

Most UX conferences are boring.
