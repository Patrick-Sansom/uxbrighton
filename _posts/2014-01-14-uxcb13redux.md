UX Brighton kicks off the new year in fine style with a redux from the fabulous event that was UX Camp Brighton 2013. Come and join us at the Lighthouse on 14th January and relive some of the best sessions, with six great talks selected from the day:

###Five things I know about UX from going to the toilet
####[Chris How](http://www.twitter.com/chrishow)
Toilets can be places for thinking. A haven where thoughts like 'what shall I talk about at UX Camp Brighton?' come to be considered. In my talk I'll be sharing photos of toilets I've collected over many years to illustrate among other things: Semiotics, designing for the user's abilities, triggering behavioural change and the sheer good, bad and bizarre of toilet interface design.

###Resistance to change - strategies for presenting usability findings
####[Ben Sauer](http://www.twitter.com/bensauer)
Ever presented results from usability testing and nothing changed? I'll present some strategies I've used in the past to successfully win friends and influence people.

###10 football tips for successful workshop facilitation
####[Viviana Doctorovich](http://www.twitter.com/vivdoc)
One thing Viviana has learned on her 8 years as UX Designer is that close collaboration with colleagues, clients and users is paramount to the success of any digital project. In her quest to promote collaboration, she runs regular workshops of all shapes and sizes and considers them a core part of her design process. In her talk, Viviana will share some of the tips and tools she's picked up through her many years as a facilitator and a few stories from the trenches. And why football tips? Just because she's Argentinian and can't miss an opportunity to talk about Messi.
