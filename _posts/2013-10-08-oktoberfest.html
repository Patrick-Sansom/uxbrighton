<p>UX Brighton evenings are back with UX Oktoberfest - our last event before November's big conference. 
Join us on 8th October at Fabrica Gallery for three talks from three fantastic speakers, none of whom - sadly - have consented to wearing their lederhosen. </p>
<h2>Talks</h2>

Andy is a regular speaker at international conferences like The Web 2.0 Expo, An Event Apart and SXSW. In May 2010, Wired Magazine named Andy one of the top 100 most influential people in the UK digital sector, much to the pride of his mother and the surprise of everybody else. </p>  
  <h3>Using Design for Competitive Advantage</h3>
  <p>Why do so many digital companies favour technology over design? In his talk Andy will explain How startups (and any other business) can use design for more than making something pretty. Instead Andy believes that design is one of the few areas of competitive advantage left.</p>
