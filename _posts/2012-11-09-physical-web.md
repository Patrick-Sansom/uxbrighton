The web has spilled beyond the screen and into the physical world. The Internet of Things (IOT) brings net connectivity to household appliances, common everyday objects and novel devices.

But what challenges does this brave new world present to UX designers? What heuristics, interaction metaphors and prototyping techniques can we rely on to create great user experiences for the web of things? Join us for an evening with three fantastic speakers who'll share their stories of designing the next generation of smart objects.
