We kick the new year off with a terrific replay of five talks from UX Camp Brighton 2014. With so many great sessions, selecting just five has been tricky. What we've gone for represents a nice spread of the huge range of topics covered on the day. Speakers for the evening will be:

<!--Tickets will be released in two batches:

<!--Don't forget add yourself as attending on [Lanydrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/uxcb14redux/ "")-->

## Ellen de Vries

### The choreography of space

The average person spends more time thinking about things, rather than the spaces between things. Fact. Space is content. This talk is about how artists morph, mould and manipulate space (and the spaces between things) to adjust the way we receive information. There will be flash cards and some hardcore choreographic theory.

Ellen is a content strategist & experimental performance arts maker.
