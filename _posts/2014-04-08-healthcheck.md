The April edition of UX Brighton takes on the big challenges of designing for health and wellbeing. Say hello to our three fantastic speakers.

### Emotional UX

Denise will explore some of the subconscious rules-of-thumb that people use to help them make decisions, change their behaviour and navigate their way through everyday life, and how we can use this insight to improve customer experience in health and care.

#### Denise Hampson

A former British Women’s Track Cycling Champion, Denise spent six years on the Great Britain Cycling Team, representing her country at European, Commonwealth and World level.

Prior to her athletic career Denise was a Systems Engineer at BAE Systems, specialising in human-system interaction and cockpit development on military aircraft.This started a career-long obsession with human-centered design and creating systems and services which are best matched to real human behaviour.Denise’s company, Hampson Solutions Ltd, provides consultancy services and training on behaviour change psychology to UK health organisations, and for the last 18 months she has worked in digital behaviour change commissioning for NHS England.

### Medication reminder apps: the Bad and the Ugly

Katarzyna's talk will explore how women remember their oral contraception pills and what technologies or memory aids they use. Katarzyna will compare these strategies with functionality of medication reminder apps available for iPhones and Android phones to highlight the fact that these apps aren't very good. She'll go on to cover recommendations for designing medication reminders that meet users' needs.

#### Katarzyna Stawarz

Katarzyna is currently doing a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction at UCL Interaction Centre and is interested in technologies supporting behaviour change. Her research focuses on understanding how mobile apps could facilitate the creation of resilient medication-taking habits.
