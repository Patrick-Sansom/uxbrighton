# UX Brighton beta site:

To set up a local version of the UX Brighton website, you will need [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). If you've not worked with Jekyll before, follow the [quick start guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/), ensuring you have all the [dependencies](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) installed first.
