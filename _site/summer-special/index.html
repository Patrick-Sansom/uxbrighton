			<p>This event took place on the 13 August, 2013</p>
			
			
			<p>UX Brighton is back! Join us on the 13th of August at the beautiful Fabrica Gallery for an evening with some truly inspiring speakers.</p>

<h2>Launching probes and releasing trojan mice - Sam Hill SamHillDesign</h2>

<p>Sam is co-founder of PAN, a critical design studio established to create enriching and affecting experiences. Established in 2011, PAN creates interactive pieces and theatrical installations, as well as designing products, systems and services to enrich every day experiences.</p>

<p>Sam will be speaking about Hello Lamp Post is a city-wide system for play – winner of Watershed’s Playable City Award and active in Bristol for 8 weeks this summer. Players are able to converse with street furniture via SMS by referencing their pre-existing maintenance codes. Sam will explain where the inspiration for the project came from, describe the development process, and show how people in Bristol have been responding to it.</p>

<h2>Oli Shaw - olishaw</h2>

<p>Oli Shaw is a strategic experience &amp; brand consultant at Fluxx. Oli is experienced in creative direction and service design. While his past is in global digital advertising for brands such as: Panasonic and Adidas, during the last 4 years he has focused on product and service innovation for clients such as: Nokia, BSkyB, Orange, Tesco, UBS. </p>

<p>Oli&#39;s talk, &quot;Launching probes and releasing trojan mice&quot;, will look at the similarity between launching a deep space probe and starting a new project, the methodology and techniques for uncovering all of the unknowns in a project. Including how to identify someone giving you a solution and how to translate it back into a requirement to work with. The talk will conclude by exploring the concept of ‘releasing trojan mice’ to provoke discussion, to create debate and most importantly as an experiment to learn from during a project. </p>

<h2>Boon Chew - boonych</h2>

<p>Boon is an interaction designer, information architect, former developer and avid sketchnoter. He currently works at SapientNitro, where he &quot;does UX&quot; for large companies like banks and telecoms. He&#39;s an active member of the UX community, where he currently organises regular events on interaction design as an IxDA local leader, and has organised UXCampLondon twice.</p>

<p>Boon&#39;s talk will discuss the relationship between typography and information architecture. Typography has always had an interesting relationship with IA – it’s impossible to imagine information, content, and media without it. Strangely, it seems like the two disciplines have been separated from birth sometimes, and this talk is an attempt to bridge the two back together. In this talk, Boon will address why typography and information architecture are both sides of the same coin, how typography can be used more meaningfully to improve IA, to the point that doing one or the other becomes the same thing.</p>
