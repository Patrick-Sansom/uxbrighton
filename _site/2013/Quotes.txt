I have already filled in the survey but I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the conference on Friday. Its exactly what I think more experienced UX'ers need. Most other conferences stages are populated by our peers rather than experts. So they are not really designed for people who have been around the block more than once.

UX Brighton was possibly the best web conference I've been to. Well done team @uxbri, speakers and @yandle.
